Problem 1  
Declare, define and initialize variables to represent the following:  
 age of a cat  
 grade average of a student   
 name of a football team  
 number of jelly beans in a hot tub  
 whether or not to eat pizza  
 the maximum number of people allowed in a specific night club  

Problem 2  
Ask the user for the following information: first name, last name, street number, street name. street   
type (i.e., &quot;street&quot;, &quot;road&quot;, etc) city, state and zip.  
Display in a three line format- for example:  
John Doe

Problem 3  
You are creating an online ordering program for &quot;Joe’s Hotdogs&quot;. Patrons can order hotdogs, fries and
soda. Hotdogs cost $3.50, fries cost $2.50 and soda costs $1.25. You must also include a meals tax of
6.25%.  
Ask the user for the quantity of each item they want to order, calculate the total cost of each item
and the total cost of all items ordered. Apply the meals tax and get a total due.  
Display the order, the subtotal, the tax amount and the total.  

Note that all money must be displayed with no more than 2 numbers after the decimal point (it is
acceptable if there is less than 2). Do this mathematically, not using formatting directives (which we
will cover at a later time).
